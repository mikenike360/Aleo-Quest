## The Common Thread

All these applications share a core principle: **prove properties about data without revealing the data itself**.

Whether it's proving:
- ✅ Sufficient funds for a payment (without revealing balance)
- ✅ Age eligibility (without revealing birthdate)
- ✅ Game fairness (without revealing random seeds)
- ✅ Identity verification (without exposing personal details)

Aleo makes privacy practical for real-world use cases.
